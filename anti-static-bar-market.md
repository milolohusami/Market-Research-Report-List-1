<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti Static Bar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Inductive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-static bar market comprises two main types: contact type and inductive type. Contact type anti-static bars work by directly touching surfaces to neutralize static charges, offering immediate effectiveness but requiring physical contact. In contrast, inductive type anti-static bars generate a static neutralizing ion field without direct contact, making them ideal for environments where contact is impractical. Both types are essential in industries like electronics and packaging to prevent damage from static electricity, ensuring product integrity and safety.</p></p>
