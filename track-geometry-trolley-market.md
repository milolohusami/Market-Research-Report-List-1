<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Track Geometry Trolley Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Measurement</li><li>Non-contact Measurement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Track Geometry Trolley market is divided into two primary types: contact measurement and non-contact measurement. Contact measurement involves physically touching the track to collect geometrical data, ensuring precise readings for parameters such as alignment and curvature. In contrast, non-contact measurement utilizes technologies like laser scanning and imaging, allowing for data capture without physical contact, which enhances speed and reduces wear on equipment. Both methods are essential for maintaining track safety and performance in rail infrastructure.</p></p>
