<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UV Pool Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Pressure System</li><li>Medium Pressure System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>UV pool systems are classified into low pressure and medium pressure categories based on their operational characteristics. Low pressure systems utilize low-intensity UV lamps that emit UV-C light at specific wavelengths, effectively targeting microorganisms with longer exposure times. In contrast, medium pressure systems operate with higher intensity lamps, producing a broader spectrum of UV light for faster disinfection. Both systems are effective for maintaining pool water quality, but they vary in efficiency, energy consumption, and application suitability depending on pool size and usage.</p></p>
